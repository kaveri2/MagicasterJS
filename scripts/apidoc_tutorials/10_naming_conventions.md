## Naming conventions ##

- When asset or value syntax is used in Magicast data, the XML node is named "value" or "asset", or ends with the words. For example "seek" method of video component takes time parameter in "timeValue" node, as the time is given value syntax.
- When component's action sets something immediately, the method is called "setSomething". If it sets something with a delay, it's called "changeSomething"
